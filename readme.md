just a bot that sends messages
and can send emojis like a nitro user because all bots have nitro

how to use it:

install node

make a file called "config.txt" and put your bot key in the first line, username in second, password in the third, and port in the last

npm install

run "node app.js" from the command line in the bots directory

navagate to localhost:12345 in a browser (replace 12345 with your port) to send messages
